Itâ€™s easy to create a Windows form in C#. All you need to do is use the
Windows Application Wizard, and you have a form. Then you just add controls
by dragging them onto the form and manipulating their properties and events.
After you place the controls on the form, you can modify the controls using
their properties and events at runtime. Many colleges and universities have a
C++ programming course. Some take advantage of the Integrated
Development Environment (IDE) provided by Visual C++ (or Visual Studio) to
teach students Windows form application programming. They frequently focus
the teaching on how to use IDE to build the application with minimum or no
hand coding involved. However, students need hand-coding experience to
truly understand the structure of Windows-based applications. In this paper,
the author advocates the necessity to teach Windows form application
programming with hand coding, without the use of IDE
